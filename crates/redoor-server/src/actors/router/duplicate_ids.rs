//! Detection of several machines that share one device id.
//!
//! Copying a home directory, VM image or container image copies a standalone agent's
//! `<data_dir>/agent-id`, so the clones send the same id in `hello`. A reconnect of an id
//! normally replaces the old connection, which would make the clones evict each other forever.
//! Hostnames cannot tell clones from reconnects (clones usually keep them), so the router
//! looks at behavior instead: a real reconnect replaces a dead or dying connection once, while
//! clones keep replacing each other's healthy ones. After [`TAKEOVER_LIMIT`] such replacements
//! within [`TAKEOVER_WINDOW`] the router keeps the current connection and refuses newcomers
//! with `duplicate_id` while it stays healthy, and shows a warning on the device.
